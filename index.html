        <P><b></P>PHP</b> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer <i>Rasmus Lerdorf</i> in <mark>1993</mark> and released in <mark>1995</mark>.<br><br>
         The <b>PHP</b> reference implementation is now produced by the <b>PHP</b> Group.<b>PHP</b> was originally an abbreviation of <q>Personal Home Page</q>,but it now stands for the recursive backronym <u>PHP:Hypertext Preprocessor.</u></P>
        <P>Beginning on <mark>28 June 2011</mark>, the <b>PHP</b> Development Team implemented a timeline for the release of new versions of <b>PHP</b>. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. Once per year, a minor release should occur which may include new features.<br><br> Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year release process.<br><br> A <mark>2024</mark> RFC extended the length of the security fix only period to two years, fixed all end of life dates to 31 December, and removed the exception that allowed for "small and self-contained" features to be introduced in patch versions.
