        <P><b></P>PHP</b> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer <i>Rasmus Lerdorf</i> in <mark>1993</mark> and released in <mark>1995</mark>.<br><br>
         The <b>PHP</b> reference implementation is now produced by the <b>PHP</b> Group.<b>PHP</b> was originally an abbreviation of <q>Personal Home Page</q>,but it now stands for the recursive backronym <u>PHP:Hypertext Preprocessor.</u></P>
        <P>Beginning on <mark>28 June 2011</mark>, the <b>PHP</b> Development Team implemented a timeline for the release of new versions of <b>PHP</b>. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. Once per year, a minor release should occur which may include new features.
